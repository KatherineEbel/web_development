1. What are the required components of an HTTP request?
  - HTTP method and path are required. Parameters, headers, and body are optional.
    - The method (usually GET or POST)
    - the path of the server
    - optionally parameters for the request ?due=today
2. What are the required components of an HTTP response? What are the additional components?
  - Status code required. Content and body optional
    - Status code (200 if OK) others include 303, 400 or 500 variations
    - Content type (so browser knows how to process response)
    - Body or payload containing the data that server sent.
3. What determines whether a request should use GET or POST as its HTTP method?
  - Use get when you need to retrieve data from server
  - Use post when you want to send data (change data that is stored)to server
    - Search forms actually use GET since they are not changing any of the info on the server.
4. Is the host component of a URL included as part of an HTTP request?
  - no. No it is only used to establish the connection.
  - Only the URL's path and parameters are included in the actual request.

HTTP is a text-based protocol that is the foundation of the web.
There are two parties involved in HTTP: the client and the server.
A complete HTTP interaction involves a request which is sent from the client to the server, and a response which is sent from the server to the client.
A request is sent to a host and must include a method and a path. It may also include parameters, headers, or a body.
GET is the HTTP method used to retrieve a resource from the server.
A response must include a status. It may also include headers or a body.
A 200 OK status in a response means the request was successful.
Modern web browsers include debugging tools that allow you to inspect the HTTP activity of a page.

http:// localhost :3003 / ?rolls=2&sides=6
protocol  host    port  path  parameters(query)

another style is http:// localhost :3003 /rolls/2/sides/6
